## Diagnosis

**Application:** jinja_prompt_project

**Log Files:** No log files were found in the project directory (`C:/Users/latif/OneDrive/Desktop/Internship training/jinja_prompt_project`). There are also no subdirectories that might contain logs.

**Possible reasons:**

• The application may not be configured to generate logs.
• The application has not started successfully due to the missing `HOST` and `PORT` environment variables, so no logs have been created.

**Resolution Steps:**

1. First, fix the missing `HOST` and `PORT` variables in your `.env` file. (See previous message for instructions.)
2. After the application starts, check again for log files.
3. If you would like to enable or configure logging, consider adding logging setup in your `main.py` file using Python's logging module. For example:
4. Run your application and verify that `app.log` (or your chosen log file) is created in the directory.

If you need a specific logging configuration or further help, please let me know!
