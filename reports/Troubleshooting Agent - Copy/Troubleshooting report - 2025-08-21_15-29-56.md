## Diagnosis

**Based on logs from:**

• `chemin/bis/tetra.log`
• `chemin/bis/laravel.log`
• `chemin/bis/access.log`
• `test/var/env/app.log`
• `test/var/env/nginx_error.log`

**Key issues identified:**

1. Application Misconfiguration: Missing database tables, missing environment variables (APP_KEY, HOST, PORT), and failed database/Redis/SMTP connections.
2. File Permissions: Application cannot write to storage/log directories or cache due to permission errors.
3. Missing or Broken Application Code: Controllers referenced in routes but not found; undefined variables in Blade views.
4. Web Server (nginx) Issues: Connection refused to upstream, missing static files, SSL handshake failures, timeouts, and large response header errors.
5. High System Memory Usage: Only 10% RAM available, which may degrade performance or cause timeouts.
6. Connectivity Failure: Missing HOST or PORT prevents proper network configuration/checks.

## Resolution Steps

1. Set All Required Environment Variables:Ensure `.env` contains valid `APP_KEY`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `MAIL_HOST`, `MAIL_PORT`, etc.
2. Restart application after setting variables.
3. Fix Database Issues:Run migrations to create missing tables: `php artisan migrate`.
4. Verify database server is running and accessible on configured host/port.
5. Correct File Permissions:Grant write permissions to `storage`, `storage/logs`, and `storage/framework/cache` for the user running the application.
6. Resolve Missing Classes and View Variables:Ensure all controllers referenced in routes exist and are correctly namespaced/imported.
7. Fix undefined or null variables in Blade views.
8. Address nginx/Web Server Errors:Check nginx config for correct upstream and SSL settings.
9. Provide all required static files (e.g., favicon.ico, style.css).
10. Adjust client_max_body_size, proxy_buffer_size, and other relevant settings as needed.
11. Fix SSL Issues:Ensure valid SSL certificates are installed and trusted by the server.
12. Check OpenSSL configuration and certificate chain.
13. Reduce Memory Usage:Restart unnecessary processes or applications to free RAM.
14. Consider upgrading memory if usage remains high.
15. Set HOST and PORT for Connectivity:Ensure these environment variables are set so connectivity checks and network operations can succeed.

System and connectivity checks indicate critical misconfiguration and high memory usage. Address the steps above in order of severity for immediate improvement.
