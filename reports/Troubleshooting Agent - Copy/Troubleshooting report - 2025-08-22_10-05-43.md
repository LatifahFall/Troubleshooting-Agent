### Findings

• Critical missing environment variables: HOST or PORT are not set. This blocks connectivity to database and web components.
• High memory usage: System RAM is at 89.2%, which could impact performance.
• Application errors: Missing DB table (`users`), undefined variables in views, missing controller class, and file write permission errors.
• Web server errors: Missing favicon.ico, SSL handshake failure, upstream buffering warnings.

**System and disk checks are clear (aside from high memory usage). Connectivity check is NOT CLEAR due to missing environment variables.**

### Step-by-Step Resolution

1. Edit your `.env` file: Ensure `HOST` and `PORT` (and if applicable, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`) are set correctly. Save and restart your application.
2. Database: Run migrations to create missing tables: `php artisan migrate` (or your stack's equivalent).
3. Check DB credentials: Confirm that connection info in `.env` matches your database configuration.
4. Code fixes:In `profile.blade.php`, ensure `$user` is always defined before rendering.
5. In `post.blade.php`, add null checks before accessing `title`.
6. Add or correct the `AdminController` class and its import (`use`) statements.
7. Permissions: Grant write permission to the `/storage/logs` directory.
8. Web server: Add a `favicon.ico` or configure the server to suppress this error.
9. Resolve SSL handshake issues by checking your certificate and server configuration.
10. If high RAM usage persists, close other applications or consider a RAM upgrade.

If you need detailed guidance on any step above, let me know which issue you'd like to tackle first!
