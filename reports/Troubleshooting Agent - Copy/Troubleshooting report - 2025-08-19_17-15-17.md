## Diagnosis

Based on analysis of logs from `./chemin/bis/tetra.log`, `./chemin/bis/laravel.log`, `./chemin/bis/access.log`, `./test/var/env/app.log`, and `./test/var/env/nginx_error.log`, as well as system and connectivity checks, your application is facing several critical issues:

‚Ä¢ Missing or incorrect environment variables (including HOST, PORT, APP_KEY), leading to failed connectivity to the database, Redis, mail server, and possibly other services.
‚Ä¢ Database issues: missing tables (e.g., `users`), connection refused, and slow queries.
‚Ä¢ File and directory permission problems: unable to write logs or cache files, causing runtime failures.
‚Ä¢ SSL and certificate errors: failed SSL handshakes and certificate validation errors affecting secure endpoints.
‚Ä¢ Missing controllers/classes and undefined variables in Laravel Blade views, leading to application crashes.
‚Ä¢ Web server issues: connection errors between Nginx and the app backend, missing static files, and some resource exhaustion (RAM usage > 90%).

### Resolution Steps

1. Set all required environment variables in your application's `.env` file, especially for database, cache, mail, Redis, HOST, PORT, and APP_KEY. Ensure they are not missing or empty.
2. Run database migrations to create missing tables:`php artisan migrate`
3. Fix file permissions for `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/` so the web server and PHP process can write logs and cache files.
4. Check for missing classes/controllers in your codebase (e.g., `AdminController`, `UserController`). Implement or properly import these classes.
5. Fix undefined variables in Blade templates by ensuring all expected variables are passed from controllers to views.
6. Resolve SSL errors by ensuring valid certificates are installed and trusted on both server and client sides. Update Nginx SSL configuration if needed.
7. Address network and upstream errors by verifying backend services (e.g., Laravel on 127.0.0.1:8000) are running and accessible from Nginx. Check firewall and port forwarding if using Docker or Windows Subsystem for Linux.
8. Monitor system resources. Consider increasing available RAM or optimizing application memory usage to reduce risk of out-of-memory failures.

System and connectivity checks revealed configuration errors rather than hardware/network faults.

If you need detailed steps for any of the above, let me know which area you want to address first!
