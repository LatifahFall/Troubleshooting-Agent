## Diagnosis for Application: Tetra (Laravel-based)

• **Log files analyzed:**chemin/bis/tetra.log
• chemin/bis/laravel.log
• chemin/bis/access.log

**System check:** OS is Windows 10, 85% memory used, disk space is sufficient.**Connectivity check:** Failed due to missing HOST or PORT environment variables.

### Summary of Issues Found

1. Database Table Missing: 'users' table does not exist, causing SQL errors.
2. Variable/Null Issues in Blade Templates: Attempted to access undefined/null variables in Blade views.
3. Missing Controller Class: 'AdminController' not found, likely due to missing namespace or class file.
4. File Permission Error: Cannot write to '/storage/logs/custom.log'—this path is likely invalid/misconfigured on Windows or lacks permission.
5. Nginx/Access Issues: Missing favicon.ico (harmless, but causes 404s)
6. SSL handshake failure (likely due to misconfigured certificates or networking)
7. Response buffering on large downloads
8. HOST/PORT Not Set: Prevents network services from starting properly.

### Resolution Steps

1. Create the 'users' table in your database: Run the relevant Laravel migration: `php artisan migrate`
2. Fix undefined/null variables in Blade templates: Check the controllers and routes to ensure all required variables are passed to the views (e.g., `$user` for profile.blade.php and `$post` for post.blade.php).
3. Restore or define the AdminController class:
4. Ensure `App\Http\Controllers\AdminController` exists and is properly referenced with `use` statements in your routes/web.php.
5. Correct log file paths and permissions: Change log paths in configuration to use Windows-style paths, e.g., `storage\logs\custom.log`, and ensure the directory exists and is writable.
6. Set HOST and PORT environment variables in your `.env` file:
7. Add lines like `HOST=127.0.0.1` and `PORT=8000` to your `.env`.
8. Address SSL issues: Check that SSL certificates are present and correctly referenced in your web server config.
9. Ensure the application is not referencing Linux-specific paths for SSL files.
10. Monitor system memory usage and close unnecessary applications if you experience slowness.
