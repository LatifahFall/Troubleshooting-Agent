## Diagnosis

• Log files analyzed: - `./chemin/bis/access.log` - `./chemin/bis/laravel.log` - `./chemin/bis/tetra.log` - `./test/var/env/nginx_error.log` - `./test/var/env/app.log`

### Key Issues Identified:

1. Web server errors: Missing static files, SSL handshake failures, connection/refused and timeouts to application backend, oversized headers, and chunked encoding errors (Nginx logs).
2. Application errors: Missing/undefined variables in views, missing controller classes, slow/incomplete database queries, and critical errors such as missing tables and permission denied writing logs (Laravel logs).
3. Environment/configuration issues: Missing essential environment variables (APP_KEY, HOST, PORT), file/directory permissions problems, and missing or misconfigured database/Redis/SMTP credentials (app log + connectivity check).
4. Resource issues: High system memory usage (86% RAM in use) may degrade performance and aggravate connection timeouts.

### Resolution Steps:

1. Fix Environment Variables: Ensure all necessary environment variables are set in your `.env` file, especially `APP_KEY`, `HOST`, `PORT`, database, Redis, and mail configuration variables. Double-check your application's `.env` and relevant deployment environment settings.
2. Resolve File Permissions: Grant correct permissions to the `storage/logs` and `storage/framework/cache` directories so the application can write logs and cache files. On Linux, this would be `chmod -R 775 storage` and `chown -R www-data:www-data storage`; since you are on Windows, make sure the running user has full access to these folders.
3. Database and Redis configuration: Ensure the database and Redis services are running and network-accessible from the application server. Confirm credentials and host/port in your `.env` and that the required tables (e.g., `users`) have been migrated/created.
4. Fix application code issues: Resolve undefined variables in your Blade templates and ensure all referenced controllers exist and are imported/used correctly. Run `composer dump-autoload` or equivalent if needed.
5. Web server (Nginx/SSL): Address SSL certificate issues by ensuring valid certificates are used and the certificate chain is complete. For missing static files, verify deployment paths and file presence.
6. Reduce memory usage: Monitor running processes and stop unnecessary applications/services to free up RAM, or consider adding more memory if persistent high usage occurs.

### System and Connectivity Check Status:

• System check: No critical hardware or disk issues, but RAM usage is high.
• Connectivity check: Failed due to missing HOST/PORT environment variables – this is a root cause for database, Redis, and mail connection errors.

When you address the above issues, your application should stabilize and become accessible. If you need further, step-by-step help with any specific error, let me know!
