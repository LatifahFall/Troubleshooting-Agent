## Diagnosis

**Application:** Troubleshooting Agent

Based on analysis of the following files:

• `chemin/bis/tetra.log`
• `chemin/bis/laravel.log`
• `chemin/bis/access.log`

The following issues were identified:

1. **Database Errors:** Missing `users` table (SQLSTATE[42S02]) in the application database. This prevents user logins and other database operations.
2. **Application Errors:** Undefined variables in views, references to missing controller classes, and attempts to access properties on null objects, all indicating code or configuration issues.
3. **File Permission Issues:** The application cannot write to `/storage/logs/custom.log` due to permissions errors, potentially blocking important logging functionality.
4. **Performance Warnings:** Slow database queries and high memory usage (88.6% of system RAM in use), indicating potential performance bottlenecks.
5. **Web Server Issues:** Nginx logs show missing static files, buffering warnings, and SSL handshake failures.
6. **Connectivity Configuration:** The environment is missing critical `HOST` or `PORT` environment variables, which are likely required for proper networking and may be responsible for some connectivity and SSL issues.

### Resolution Steps

1. **Database:** Ensure the database is properly migrated and the `users` table exists. Run your migration scripts (e.g., `php artisan migrate` for Laravel) and verify the database connection settings.
2. **Application Code:** Review and fix undefined variables, null object accesses, and missing controller classes in your codebase. Check the stack traces in the logs for exact file and line references.
3. **Permissions:** Adjust file and directory permissions so the application can write to all necessary log files, especially `/storage/logs/custom.log`.
4. **Performance:** Investigate high memory usage—check for memory leaks or resource-heavy operations. Optimize slow database queries as indicated in the logs.
5. **Web Server/SSL:** Add missing static files (like `favicon.ico`) to your `static` directory, address Nginx buffering configuration if dealing with large files, and verify your SSL certificates and configuration for correct handshakes.
6. **Connectivity:** Set the required `HOST` and `PORT` environment variables in your `.env` file or system environment, and restart your application or web server.
7. **Retest:** After addressing each issue, retest your application to confirm that errors no longer appear in the logs and that connectivity is restored.

**Note:** The system and connectivity checks both detected issues (high memory usage and missing environment variables). These should be resolved to ensure stable and reliable operation.
