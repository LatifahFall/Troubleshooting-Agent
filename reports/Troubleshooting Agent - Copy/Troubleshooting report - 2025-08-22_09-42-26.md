## Diagnosis

**Application: Troubleshooting Agent**

I have analyzed the following log files and system checks:

• **chemin/bis/tetra.log**
• **chemin/bis/laravel.log**
• **chemin/bis/access.log**
• **reports/Troubleshooting Agent/Troubleshooting report - 2025-08-21_13-10-55.md**

**Main issues identified:**

1. **Missing database table:** The 'users' table does not exist, causing application errors.
2. **Missing HOST or PORT environment variables:** Connectivity check failed, which prevents external service (e.g., database) connections.
3. **Undefined variables and missing classes:** Errors in Blade templates and missing controller class definitions.
4. **File permissions:** The app cannot write to /storage/logs/custom.log.
5. **Nginx/web server errors:** Missing favicon.ico, SSL handshake failures, and large responses being buffered.
6. **High RAM usage:** 81.6% of memory is in use (system not critical but keep monitoring).

### Resolution Steps

1. **Environment Variables:** Edit your `.env` file to ensure all required variables (such as `HOST`, `PORT`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`) are set correctly.
2. **Database Migration:** Run your framework's migration command (e.g., `php artisan migrate`) to create any missing tables like `users`.
3. **Code Fixes:**Ensure all variables used in Blade templates are defined before rendering.
4. Add null checks before accessing object properties in views.
5. Check that all controllers (e.g., `AdminController`) exist and are properly imported.
6. **Permissions:** Ensure the application has write permissions to the `/storage/logs` directory.
7. **Web Server:**Add a `favicon.ico` to `/usr/share/nginx/html` or adjust Nginx config to avoid the error.
8. Check your SSL configuration to resolve handshake failures.
9. **Performance:** Monitor RAM usage and consider closing unused applications or increasing system memory if issues persist.

All system and disk checks are clear except for high RAM usage. **Connectivity check is NOT CLEAR** due to missing environment variables.

If you need detailed instructions on any specific step or encounter further issues, let me know!
