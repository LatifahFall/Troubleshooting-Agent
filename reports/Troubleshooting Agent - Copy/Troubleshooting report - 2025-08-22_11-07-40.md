## Diagnosis: Troubleshooting Agent Application

**Log files analyzed:** - chemin/bis/tetra.log - chemin/bis/laravel.log - chemin/bis/access.log

### Summary of Issues Identified

• Laravel application errors:Missing database table: `project.users`
• Null property access in Blade template
• Missing `AdminController` class
• File permission error writing to logs
• Undefined variable `$user` in profile view
• Slow database queries

NGINX errors:

• Missing static file (`favicon.ico`)
• Buffered large file responses
• SSL handshake failure

System resource issue: High memory usage (88% used, only 1.83GB free)Connectivity configuration issue: Missing `HOST` or `PORT` environment variables

### Resolution Steps

1. Database: Verify that the `users` table exists in the `project` database. Run migrations if necessary: php artisan migrate
2. Blade Template Errors:Check controllers and views for correct variable passing (e.g., `$user` in `profile.blade.php` and `title` in `post.blade.php` must be set and not null).
3. Missing Controller: Ensure `AdminController` exists in `App\Http\Controllers` and is properly imported in `routes/web.php`.
4. File Permissions: Ensure the application has write permissions to `/storage/logs/custom.log`. Update permissions as needed.
5. Performance: Investigate causes of slow database queries (e.g., missing indexes, large tables).
6. NGINX Issues:Add a `favicon.ico` to `/usr/share/nginx/html/` or update NGINX config to prevent errors.
7. Optimize large file delivery settings in NGINX if buffering is an issue.
8. Check SSL certificate configuration and ensure client/server compatibility to resolve handshake failure.
9. System Memory: Consider freeing up memory by closing other applications or upgrading RAM if performance issues persist.
10. Connectivity Variables: Set the `HOST` and `PORT` environment variables in your `.env` file to enable proper connectivity (e.g., `HOST=127.0.0.1` and `PORT=8000`).

System and connectivity checks have highlighted configuration issues that must be addressed for stable application operation.
