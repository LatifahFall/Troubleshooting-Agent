## Diagnosis

• Database Errors: Missing tables and connection refused errors are present, indicating either a misconfigured or uninitialized database. (Logs: `chemin/bis/tetra.log`, `test/var/env/app.log`)
• Application Configuration Issues: Missing environment variables (e.g., `APP_KEY`, `HOST`, `PORT`) are preventing proper startup and connectivity. (Logs: `test/var/env/app.log`, connectivity check)
• File Permission Problems: Several logs show permission denied errors when writing to log or cache directories. (Logs: `chemin/bis/tetra.log`, `test/var/env/app.log`)
• Missing Classes/Controllers: Code is referencing controllers that do not exist or are not autoloaded correctly. (Logs: `chemin/bis/tetra.log`, `test/var/env/app.log`)
• SSL/HTTPS Issues: Multiple SSL handshake failures and certificate errors are recorded, likely due to missing or misconfigured certificates. (Logs: `chemin/bis/access.log`, `test/var/env/app.log`, `test/var/env/nginx_error.log`)
• High Memory Usage: System memory is nearly full, which may cause degraded performance or timeouts. (System check)
• Network/Connectivity Issues: Upstream connection errors, timeouts, and missing HOST/PORT environment variables are affecting connectivity. (Logs: `test/var/env/nginx_error.log`, connectivity check)
• Static & Cache Directory Problems: Missing static files and unwritable cache directories are causing additional errors. (Logs: `test/var/env/app.log`, `test/var/env/nginx_error.log`)

## Resolution Steps

1. Database Setup: Ensure your database is running, the connection credentials are set correctly in your environment, and all required tables (e.g., `users`) are created. Run migrations if using Laravel: php artisan migrate
2. Set Required Environment Variables: Define `APP_KEY`, `HOST`, `PORT`, and any other mandatory env variables in your `.env` file. Generate an app key for Laravel if missing: php artisan key:generate
3. Fix File Permissions: Adjust permissions on storage and cache directories so the application can write logs and cache data. Example command on Unix systems: chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache On Windows, ensure the web server user has write access to these directories.
4. Resolve Missing Classes: Check that all referenced controllers exist, are named correctly, and are included via Composer autoload. Run composer dump-autoload after adding new classes.
5. SSL Certificate Configuration: Install valid SSL certificates and configure web server (e.g., nginx) to use them. Ensure the certificate chain is complete and trusted.
6. Address Memory Usage: Close unused applications or upgrade server RAM. Consider optimizing application memory consumption.
7. Resolve Connectivity Issues: Make sure HOST and PORT are defined for all services (database, Redis, mail, etc.) and reachable from the application server.
8. Restore Static/Cache Files: Ensure all referenced static files exist in the correct locations, and cache directories are present and writable.

All analysis is based on logs from:`chemin/bis/tetra.log`, `chemin/bis/laravel.log`, `chemin/bis/access.log`, `test/var/env/app.log`, `test/var/env/nginx_error.log`

System and connectivity checks are NOT clear due to missing environment variables and high memory usage. These must be corrected for normal operation.

If you need more help with any step, let me know which area you want to focus on.
