## Diagnosis for the Application

The following issues were identified based on log files and system/environment checks:

• **Database/Table Missing**: `tetra.log` (path: `chemin/bis/tetra.log`) reports SQL errors indicating the `users` table does not exist. This will prevent user authentication and related features.
• **Code Errors**: Both `tetra.log` and `laravel.log` (`chemin/bis/laravel.log`) show undefined variables, null property accesses, and missing controller classes. These are critical for normal operation and must be fixed in the codebase.
• **File Permissions**: `tetra.log` reports permission denied when writing to `/storage/logs/custom.log`. This will stop custom logging and could break other features expecting write access.
• **Performance Issues**: `laravel.log` warns of slow SQL queries. The system check shows high memory usage (over 84%). This may contribute to slow performance or failures under load.
• **Nginx/Web Server Issues**: `access.log` (`chemin/bis/access.log`) shows missing frontend assets, buffering of large files, and SSL handshake failures. These affect both user experience and security.
• **Connectivity/Configuration**: The connectivity check failed due to missing `HOST` or `PORT` environment variables. This must be corrected for proper application startup and networking.

### Resolution Steps

1. Check database migrations and ensure the `users` table exists. Run all necessary migrations.
2. Review and fix code issues reported in your logs: Declare and initialize variables before use in Blade views.
3. Check for null values before property access.
4. Ensure all controllers (like `AdminController`) are correctly defined and imported.
5. Correct file permissions on `/storage/logs` so the application user can write logs.
6. Optimize your database (add indexes, review queries) and consider increasing system memory or optimizing running services to reduce memory usage.
7. For Nginx/web server: Add a `favicon.ico` to your `static` or web root directory.
8. Review proxy/buffering settings for large file handling.
9. Check and update your SSL certificate and configuration.
10. Update your `.env` file to include the required `HOST` and `PORT` variables for proper app startup.

**System checks and disk space are fine, but memory usage is high. Connectivity check is NOT clear and must be fixed as described above.**
