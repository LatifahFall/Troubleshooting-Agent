## Diagnosis for Troubleshooting Agent

Application logs reviewed from: - chemin/bis/tetra.log - chemin/bis/laravel.log - chemin/bis/access.log

### Summary of Issues Identified

• Database Error: Missing table `users` in the database (`tetra.log`)
• Application Errors:Undefined variable `$user` in profile view (`laravel.log`)
• Attempt to read property `title` on null (`tetra.log`)
• Class `AdminController` not found (`tetra.log`)
• File permission issue writing to `/storage/logs/custom.log` (`tetra.log`)

Web Server Issues:

• Missing `favicon.ico` (`access.log`)
• Large response buffered (possible performance issue) (`access.log`)
• SSL handshake failure (`access.log`)

System Resources: High memory usage (88.5% used, only 1.76 GB available)Connectivity:Missing HOST or PORT environment variables (connectivity check failed)

### Step-by-Step Resolution

1. Database Issue - Ensure the `users` table exists in your database (`project.users`). - Run migrations or create the missing table as required for your application.
2. Application Code Issues - Fix or initialize the `$user` variable in `profile.blade.php`. - Check logic that retrieves post data to avoid accessing `title` on null values. - Ensure `AdminController` exists and is properly imported in `web.php`. - Check permissions for `/storage/logs/custom.log`, and make sure the application has write access.
3. Web Server Issues - Add a `favicon.ico` to the web root if desired. - Investigate any performance bottlenecks or client requests causing large buffers. - Examine SSL certificate and configuration to resolve handshake failures.
4. System Resources - Consider closing unused applications or increasing system RAM if performance is impacted.
5. Connectivity Variables - Set the `HOST` and `PORT` environment variables required by your application. Update your `.env` file or system environment accordingly.

System and connectivity checks show issues only with environment variables. No critical OS or network errors detected otherwise.
