## Diagnosis

**Application:** Troubleshooting Agent

The core issue preventing application connectivity is missing environment variables in the `.env` file, specifically `HOST` and `PORT`. This is confirmed by both the connectivity check and the latest troubleshooting report.

### Relevant log and config files analyzed:

• reports/Troubleshooting Agent/Troubleshooting report - 2025-08-21_13-10-55.md
• .env

### System Status:

• Disk space: OK
• RAM usage: High (82.4%) – may affect performance

### Connectivity Status:

• Critical: `HOST` or `PORT` environment variables are missing

## Resolution Steps

1. **Edit the `.env` file in the application root directory:** Add the following lines, adjusting the values as needed for your environment: HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=8000 (If your setup requires different values, such as a specific hostname or port, substitute accordingly.) 
2. **Restart your application** so it can read the new environment variables.
3. If you continue to see connectivity errors, verify that any other required variables (e.g., `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, etc.) are present and correct in `.env`.
4. Consider addressing high RAM usage by closing unneeded applications or increasing system memory if performance issues persist.

Once you have added the missing variables and restarted the application, the connectivity issue should be resolved.

If you need the exact list of all required environment variables for your stack, please let me know!
