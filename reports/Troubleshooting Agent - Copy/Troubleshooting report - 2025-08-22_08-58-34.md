## Diagnosis for Troubleshooting Agent

**Log files analyzed:**

• chemin/bis/tetra.log
• chemin/bis/laravel.log
• chemin/bis/access.log

### Summary of Issues:

• Database errors: Missing table (`project.users`), slow queries, and possible connectivity issues.
• Application errors: Undefined variables in views, missing controller class, attempts to access properties of null, and failed file writes due to permission errors.
• Web server errors: Missing static files (e.g., `favicon.ico`), issues buffering large upstream responses, and SSL handshake failures.
• System status: High RAM usage (86%), sufficient disk space.
• Connectivity error: Missing `HOST` or `PORT` environment variables, preventing network checks.

### Resolution Steps:

1. Database:Check your database configuration in the `.env` file and ensure `HOST` and `PORT` are set correctly.
2. Verify that the `users` table exists in the `project` database. If missing, run your database migrations to create the required tables.
3. Application code:Ensure all variables required by your Blade views are being passed from controllers (e.g., `$user` in `profile.blade.php`).
4. Fix or add the missing `AdminController` class and ensure it is properly imported and referenced in `web.php`.
5. Check for null objects before accessing their properties in your views and controllers.
6. File permissions:Ensure the application has write permissions to `/storage/logs/` or the equivalent logs directory on your system.
7. Web server configuration:Add a `favicon.ico` to your `static` or web root directory to resolve the missing file error.
8. Review buffering and proxy settings for large file downloads in your Nginx configuration.
9. Check SSL certificate validity and server configuration to resolve handshake failures.
10. System resources:Monitor and reduce RAM usage if possible, as high memory usage may impact performance.
11. Connectivity:Set the required `HOST` and `PORT` environment variables for all services your application needs to connect to.

System and connectivity checks have completed with issues found (connectivity variables missing, high RAM usage).

Please address the above issues and re-test the application. If you need more detailed steps for any specific error, let me know!
