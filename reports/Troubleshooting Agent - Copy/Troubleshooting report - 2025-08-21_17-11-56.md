## Diagnosis

• **Configuration Issues**: Several environment variables (such as HOST, PORT, and APP_KEY) are missing or not set, causing failures for database, Redis, mail, and other services. This is confirmed by the connectivity check error and application logs (`test/var/env/app.log`).
• **File/Directory Permissions**: The application lacks permissions to write to log, cache, and storage directories (`test/var/env/app.log`, `chemin/bis/tetra.log`).
• **Missing or Misconfigured Classes/Controllers**: Errors indicate that controllers like `AdminController` and `UserController` are not found, pointing to possible missing files or incorrect namespaces (`chemin/bis/tetra.log`, `test/var/env/app.log`).
• **Database Table Missing**: The `users` table does not exist, leading to SQL errors (`chemin/bis/tetra.log`).
• **SSL/TLS Problems**: Multiple SSL handshake failures suggest certificate issues, missing CA bundles, or incompatible SSL settings (`chemin/bis/access.log`, `test/var/env/nginx_error.log`).
• **Service Unavailability**: Connection refused and timeout errors for database, Redis, and upstream services (`test/var/env/app.log`, `test/var/env/nginx_error.log`).
• **High Memory Usage**: The system is running at over 80% memory usage, which could degrade performance or cause timeouts (system check).

## Resolution Steps

1. Set Required Environment Variables:Ensure `HOST`, `PORT`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `REDIS_HOST`, `MAIL_HOST`, and `APP_KEY` are properly set in your `.env` file.
2. Generate a new APP_KEY with `php artisan key:generate` if missing.
3. Fix File Permissions:Ensure the application user has read/write permissions on `storage`, `logs`, and `cache` directories. On Linux, use `chmod -R 775 storage logs cache` and `chown -R www-data:www-data storage logs cache` as appropriate.
4. Restore or Create Missing Database Tables:Run migrations with `php artisan migrate` to create the `users` table and any others.
5. Check and Fix Controller Files:Verify that `AdminController` and `UserController` exist in `app/Http/Controllers` and correct any missing `use` statements or typos in route files.
6. Resolve SSL/TLS Issues:Install valid SSL certificates and ensure CA bundles are present.
7. Check Nginx/Apache SSL configuration for protocol compatibility.
8. Address Service Connection Issues:Ensure your database, Redis, and mail services are running and reachable at the specified host/port.
9. Check firewall settings that might block required ports.
10. Reduce Memory Usage:Investigate memory-intensive applications and restart services if needed to free up RAM.

**System and connectivity checks revealed misconfiguration but otherwise no hardware or network failures. Please address the above issues and re-test your application.**

Log files analyzed: `chemin/bis/tetra.log`, `chemin/bis/laravel.log`, `chemin/bis/access.log`, `test/var/env/app.log`, `test/var/env/nginx_error.log`.
