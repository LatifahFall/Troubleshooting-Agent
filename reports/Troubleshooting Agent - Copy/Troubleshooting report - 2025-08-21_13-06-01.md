## Diagnosis

• **Application configuration and environment issues:** - `app.log` and `tetra.log` reveal missing or misconfigured environment variables (e.g., `APP_KEY`, missing HOST/PORT for services), leading to failed database, Redis, mail, and session connections. - Laravel errors such as missing classes, undefined variables, and permission denied to log or cache directories further indicate incomplete or incorrect deployment.
• **Web server (Nginx) issues:** - `nginx_error.log` and `access.log` show upstream connection refusals, SSL handshake failures, missing static files, and buffer/header issues, indicating both application connectivity problems and possible SSL misconfiguration.
• **System resource constraints:** - System check reports high memory usage (86.7% used, only 2.05 GB free of 15.37 GB), which can cause service timeouts or instability.
• **Connectivity Check:** - Explicit failure due to missing HOST/PORT environment variables. This directly explains many refused or timed out connections in logs. 

## Resolution Steps

1. **Fix Environment Variables:** - Set all required environment variables (`APP_KEY`, database/Redis/SMTP HOST, PORT, USER, PASSWORD, etc.) in your `.env` file. - Verify their presence and correctness before deploying or restarting the application.
2. **Resolve Permissions:** - Ensure your application has read/write permissions to `storage/logs`, `storage/framework/cache`, and custom log directories.
3. **Address Application Errors:** - Fix undefined variables in Blade views and check for missing controllers (add or correct `use` statements). - Run `php artisan migrate` to create missing database tables (e.g., `users`). - Review and optimize slow database queries.
4. **Correct SSL and Web Server Configurations:** - Ensure valid SSL certificates are installed and referenced in your web server config. - Fix missing static files by checking deployment packaging and Nginx root paths.
5. **Manage System Resources:** - Investigate high memory usage; restart unnecessary services, optimize code, or upgrade memory if needed.
6. **Reconnect External Services:** - Ensure external services (database, Redis, mail, queue) are running, reachable, and correctly referenced in configs.

**Log sources reviewed:** - chemin/bis/access.log - chemin/bis/laravel.log - chemin/bis/tetra.log - test/var/env/app.log - test/var/env/nginx_error.log

System and connectivity checks were performed and confirm the diagnosis above.
