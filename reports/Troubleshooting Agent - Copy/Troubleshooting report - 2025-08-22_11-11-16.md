## Rapport de l'agent

## Diagnosis

**Application:** Troubleshooting Agent

**Log files analyzed:**

• `chemin/bis/access.log`
• `chemin/bis/laravel.log`
• `chemin/bis/tetra.log`
• `./.env`

**System and connectivity checks performed and included in this report.**

### Main Issues Detected

• **Critical:** Missing `HOST` or `PORT` environment variables in `.env` file, preventing connectivity to essential services (confirmed by connectivity check and log analysis).
• High RAM usage: 89.5% used (13.76 GB of 15.37 GB), which may affect performance.
• Additional issues found in previous reports: missing database table, undefined variables in templates, file permission errors, SSL handshake failures, and web server config warnings.

### Step-by-Step Resolution

1. **Edit your `.env` file:** Add the following lines (adjust values as needed for your environment):HOST=localhost PORT=8000 DB_HOST=localhost DB_PORT=5433 Ensure these match your actual service configuration.
2. **Database:** Verify your database connection settings and run migrations to create any missing tables:php artisan migrate (or use the appropriate command for your stack).
3. **Performance:** Consider closing unused applications to free RAM, or upgrading your system RAM if you regularly encounter high usage.
4. **Other issues:** Review error logs in `chemin/bis/laravel.log` and `chemin/bis/tetra.log` for undefined variables, controller issues, and permission errors. Apply the code and configuration fixes as outlined in the previous troubleshooting report.
5. **Nginx/SSL:** Fix missing `favicon.ico` and resolve SSL configuration issues if applicable.

All system and disk checks are clear except for high memory usage. Connectivity check is NOT CLEAR due to missing environment variables.

If you need more detailed guidance on any specific error or step above, let me know!
