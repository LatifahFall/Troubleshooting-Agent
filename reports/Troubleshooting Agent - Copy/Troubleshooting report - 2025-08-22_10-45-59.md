## Diagnosis for Troubleshooting Agent Application

### Log Sources Reviewed:

• chemin/bis/tetra.log
• chemin/bis/access.log
• chemin/bis/laravel.log
• test/var/env/app.log
• test/var/env/nginx_error.log

### Diagnosis

• Database Issues: Missing or inaccessible tables (e.g., 'users'), and database connection refused. Ensure migrations are run and the DB server is running/accessible.
• Configuration Issues: Missing environment variables (e.g., APP_KEY, HOST, PORT) block both app and network connectivity. Set these in your environment (.env file or system variables).
• File Permissions: Application lacks write permission to storage/logs and cache directories. Fix this by assigning correct permissions (e.g., `chmod -R 775 storage` on Linux, or adjust via Properties on Windows).
• Code/Dependency Issues: Missing controller classes (e.g., AdminController, UserController) and undefined variables in Blade templates. Check for missing files, typos, or autoload issues. Run `composer dump-autoload` if using Laravel and ensure all controllers exist as referenced.
• SSL/Certificate Issues: Several SSL handshake and certificate validation errors in both Nginx and app logs. Ensure proper SSL certificates are installed and configured for both your server and any outgoing connections.
• Resource Issues: High memory usage detected (84.3%). Consider closing unnecessary programs or increasing system RAM if performance issues persist.
• Other Service Errors: Redis and mailer connection issues; ensure those services are running and credentials are correct in the environment configuration.

### Resolution Steps

1. Set missing environment variables (APP_KEY, HOST, PORT, database credentials, etc.) in your .env file or system environment.
2. Run all required migrations: `php artisan migrate` (for Laravel).
3. Ensure your database, Redis, and mail services are running and accessible from the application server.
4. Correct file and directory permissions for storage and cache folders.
5. Fix undefined variables and missing class/controller references in your codebase.
6. Install and correctly configure SSL certificates for both Nginx and PHP/Guzzle cURL operations.
7. If you continue to see high memory usage, consider upgrading your RAM or optimizing running applications/services.
8. After correcting .env and configuration issues, restart your application and web server.

System and connectivity checks are NOT CLEAR: High memory usage and missing environment variables for network connectivity must be addressed.
