## Diagnosis for the Laravel Application

• **Log files analyzed:**chemin/bis/tetra.log
• chemin/bis/laravel.log
• chemin/bis/access.log

### Summary of Issues Found

1. **Database Table Missing:** The `users` table does not exist (`tetra.log`), causing SQL errors when querying users.
2. **Code Errors:** Undefined variables in Blade views and missing controller classes (`laravel.log`, `tetra.log`).
3. **File Permission Issues:** The application cannot write to `/storage/logs/custom.log` due to permission denial (`tetra.log`).
4. **Web Server Problems:** Nginx is reporting missing files, SSL handshake failures, and warnings about large file buffering (`access.log`).
5. **System Resource Warning:** High memory usage (86.5%), which may degrade performance (`system_check`).
6. **Connectivity Misconfiguration:** HOST or PORT environment variables are missing, preventing network connectivity (`connectivity_check`).

### Resolution Steps

1. **Database:** Run database migrations or manually create the `users` table to resolve SQL errors.
2. **Code Fixes:**Ensure all variables used in Blade views are defined and passed from controllers.
3. Verify that `AdminController` exists and is properly imported in your routes/web.php file.
4. **File Permissions:** Check permissions for the `/storage/logs` directory and ensure the application has write access.
5. **Nginx Issues:**Add a `favicon.ico` file to the web root or update nginx config to suppress favicon errors.
6. Investigate SSL certificate validity and configuration to resolve handshake failures.
7. Increase `proxy_buffer_size` and `proxy_buffers` in nginx config to handle large file buffering.
8. **System Resources:** Close unused applications or upgrade memory if performance is a concern.
9. **Environment Variables:** Define the required `HOST` and `PORT` variables in your `.env` file to restore connectivity.

### System and Connectivity Check Status

• **System Check:** Completed with high memory usage noted.
• **Connectivity Check:** FAILED due to missing HOST/PORT environment variables.

 If you need help implementing any of these solutions, let me know which step you want to address first!
