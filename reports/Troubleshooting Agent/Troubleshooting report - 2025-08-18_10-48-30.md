Diagnosis Summary:

1. Application/database issues (from ./chemin/bis/tetra.log and ./chemin/bis/laravel.log):
   - Missing 'users' table in the database (SQLSTATE[42S02]).
   - Undefined variables and null references in Blade views.
   - Missing AdminController class.
   - Permission denied writing to /storage/logs/custom.log.
2. Web server issues (from ./chemin/bis/access.log):
   - Missing favicon.ico file.
   - NGINX buffering large upstream responses to disk.
   - Critical SSL handshake failure.
3. System check:
   - High memory usage (87%).
4. Connectivity check:
   - Missing HOST or PORT environment variable, preventing proper server/network operation.

Resolution Steps:
1. Database:
   - Ensure the 'users' table exists. If missing, run migrations (e.g., 'php artisan migrate') or restore from backup.
2. Application code:
   - Fix undefined variables and null references in Blade files (e.g., profile.blade.php, post.blade.php).
   - Ensure AdminController is defined and properly imported.
   - Set correct permissions for /storage/logs to allow logs to be written.
3. Web server:
   - Add a favicon.ico to /usr/share/nginx/html if needed.
   - Consider adjusting NGINX buffer settings for large files if buffering to disk is a performance concern.
   - Investigate and resolve SSL configuration or certificate issues to fix handshake failures.
4. System and connectivity:
   - Reduce memory usage if possible (restart unneeded processes or increase system RAM).
   - Define HOST and PORT environment variables (e.g., in .env file) to enable connectivity.

All findings are based on logs from: ./chemin/bis/tetra.log, ./chemin/bis/laravel.log, and ./chemin/bis/access.log. System and connectivity checks are included in this diagnosis.

Let me know if you need step-by-step guidance on any of the above steps or further clarification.
