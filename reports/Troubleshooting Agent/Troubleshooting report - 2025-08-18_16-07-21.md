## Summary of Issues Found (from logs at 'chemin/bis/tetra.log', 'chemin/bis/laravel.log', 'chemin/bis/access.log')

### Application/Backend Issues
1. **Database error**: Table 'users' is missing (tetra.log), causing login failures.
2. **Blade template/view error**: Attempt to access properties of null/undefined variables, e.g., $user and 'title' (tetra.log, laravel.log).
3. **Class not found**: 'AdminController' missing or not imported (tetra.log).
4. **File permission error**: Cannot write to '/storage/logs/custom.log' (tetra.log).

### Web Server/Network Issues
5. **Missing favicon.ico**: Minor Nginx error (access.log).
6. **Upstream buffering warning**: Large file buffering in Nginx (access.log).
7. **SSL handshake failure**: Nginx SSL configuration or certificate issue (access.log).

### System/Configuration
8. **High RAM usage**: Only 1.7 GB available out of 15.37 GB (system check).
9. **Missing HOST/PORT environment variables**: Prevents network service connections (connectivity check).

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Database Table Error
- Ensure the 'users' table exists in your database. Run Laravel migrations:
  ```
  php artisan migrate
  ```
- If the table/schema is missing, check your migration files for the correct definition.

### 2. Blade/View Errors
- Ensure all required variables are passed from controllers to views. E.g., pass the $user object to 'profile.blade.php'.
- Add null checks in Blade templates:
  ```blade
  {{ $user->name ?? 'Guest' }}
  ```

### 3. Missing Controller Class
- Make sure 'AdminController' exists in 'app/Http/Controllers' and is correctly imported in 'routes/web.php'.
- Use:
  ```php
  use App\Http\Controllers\AdminController;
  ```

### 4. File Permissions
- Set correct permissions for '/storage/logs' so PHP can write logs:
  ```
  chmod -R 775 storage/logs
  chown -R www-data:www-data storage/logs
  ```

### 5. Nginx/Web Issues
- Add a favicon.ico file in the web root to fix the favicon error.
- For large file buffering, review Nginx settings (like proxy_buffering).
- For SSL handshake failure, verify your SSL certificates and Nginx SSL configuration.

### 6. System Resources
- Free up memory by stopping unused applications or upgrading RAM if possible. High memory usage may degrade performance.

### 7. Missing Environment Variables
- Set the HOST and PORT variables in your .env file:
  ```
  HOST=127.0.0.1
  PORT=8000
  ```
- Restart your application after setting these variables.

### All issues above are based on logs from chemin/bis/tetra.log, chemin/bis/laravel.log, chemin/bis/access.log, as well as system and connectivity checks. System and connectivity checks are NOT clear‚Äîenvironment variables are missing, and memory is low. Please address these for full resolution.
