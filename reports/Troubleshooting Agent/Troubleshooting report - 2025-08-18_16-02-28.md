# Diagnosis

**Log Sources Consulted:**
- `chemin/bis/tetra.log`
- `chemin/bis/laravel.log`
- `chemin/bis/access.log`
- `reports/Troubleshooting Agent/Troubleshooting report - 2025-08-18_15-56-49.md`
- `test/var/env/app.log`
- `test/var/env/nginx_error.log`

## Application Issues
- **Database:**
  - The `users` table is missing, preventing user authentication and data access.
  - Database connection is sometimes refused, possibly due to misconfiguration or the service not running.
- **Environment:**
  - Required environment variables (e.g., `APP_KEY`, `HOST`, `PORT`) are missing, causing start-up failures.
- **Blade/View Errors:**
  - Undefined variables and accessing properties on null objects in Blade templates.
  - Missing controllers (e.g., `AdminController`, `UserController`).
- **Permissions:**
  - Application cannot write to the `/storage/logs/` directory or cache/session directories due to insufficient permissions.
- **Other Application Errors:**
  - Mail and Redis connection failures.
  - Queue worker timeouts.
  - Cache/session configuration issues.

## Web Server (Nginx) Issues
- **Missing static files** (e.g., `favicon.ico`, CSS), leading to repeated errors in logs.
- **Connection issues** with the application backend (connection refused, timeouts, headers too large, chunked encoding, etc.).
- **SSL handshake failures** due to certificate or cipher misconfiguration.

## System and Connectivity
- **High memory usage** reported in previous diagnostics.
- **System and connectivity checks are otherwise clear.**

# Step-by-Step Resolution

1. **Database:**
   - Ensure your database server is running and properly configured.
   - Double-check your `.env` for correct DB credentials.
   - Run migrations: `php artisan migrate` to create missing tables.

2. **Environment Variables:**
   - Set all required variables in `.env`, especially `APP_KEY`, `HOST`, and `PORT`.
   - Generate an application key with `php artisan key:generate` if needed.
   - Restart the application after changes.

3. **Permissions:**
   - Give write permissions to the `storage` and `bootstrap/cache` directories:
     ```bash
     chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
     chown -R www-data:www-data storage bootstrap/cache
     ```

4. **Controllers and Views:**
   - Ensure all referenced controllers exist and are correctly imported or autoloaded.
   - Pass all required variables to Blade views. Use null checks before accessing properties.

5. **Nginx/Web Server:**
   - Place missing static files (like `favicon.ico`, CSS) in the appropriate directories, or update server config to silence missing file errors.
   - Check your Nginx config for proper `proxy_*` and buffer settings.
   - Review and fix SSL certificate and cipher configurations (use valid certificates and compatible cipher suites).

6. **Other Services:**
   - Ensure Redis and mail services are installed, running, and properly configured.
   - Increase queue worker timeout or optimize jobs if necessary.

7. **System Resources:**
   - Monitor and increase server memory if consistently high.
