## Diagnosis

### Summary of Issues (Log Sources: './chemin/bis/tetra.log', './chemin/bis/laravel.log', './chemin/bis/access.log')

**Application Errors:**
- Missing database table: `users` table does not exist (tetra.log)
- Undefined variable in Blade view (`$user` in profile.blade.php), and null property access (`title` on null), indicating coding errors (tetra.log, laravel.log)
- Class `AdminController` not found, likely due to missing import or file (tetra.log)
- Permission denied on writing to `/storage/logs/custom.log` (tetra.log)

**Web Server (Nginx) Errors:**
- Missing `favicon.ico` file (access.log)
- Upstream buffering on large file requests, may indicate performance/memory issues (access.log)
- SSL handshake failure, likely due to misconfiguration or missing certificates (access.log)

**System & Connectivity:**
- High memory usage (81.3% used, only 2.88GB available)
- Connectivity check failed: missing HOST or PORT environment variables

## Resolution Steps

1. **Database:**
   - Run migrations to create the missing `users` table:
     ```
     php artisan migrate
     ```
   - Check your database configuration in `.env`.

2. **Blade/PHP Errors:**
   - Ensure `$user` is always passed to views like `profile.blade.php`.
   - Check for null checks before accessing properties like `title` in `post.blade.php`.
   - Verify that `AdminController` exists and is imported/registered correctly.

3. **File Permissions:**
   - Set proper permissions for `/storage/logs/`:
     ```
     chmod -R 775 /storage/logs/
     ```
   - Ensure the running user has write access.

4. **Nginx/Web Server:**
   - Add a default `favicon.ico` or update the config to avoid the missing file warning.
   - Investigate large file handling in Nginxâ€”consider increasing `proxy_buffer_size` or optimizing file serving.
   - Fix SSL configuration (check certificate paths and validity in your Nginx config).

5. **Environment Variables:**
   - Set `HOST` and `PORT` in your `.env` file:
     ```
     HOST=127.0.0.1
     PORT=8000
     ```
   - Restart your application after setting these.

6. **System Resources:**
   - Monitor and reduce memory usage; close unnecessary processes or upgrade server resources if needed.

**System and connectivity checks:**
- System check indicates high memory usage but otherwise OK.
- Connectivity issues are present due to missing environment variablesâ€”fixing those should resolve related network problems.
