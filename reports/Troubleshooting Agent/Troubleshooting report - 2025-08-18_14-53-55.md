Diagnosis

### Issues Identified

#### 1. Application-Level Problems (`./chemin/bis/tetra.log` and `./chemin/bis/laravel.log`)
- **Database Table Missing**: `project.users` table does not exist, causing login and query failures.
- **Undefined or Null Variables in Views**: Blade templates are accessing undefined or null variables (e.g., `$user` and `title`).
- **Missing Controller**: `AdminController` class is not found, likely due to a missing file or incorrect namespace/use statement.
- **Log Write Permission Error**: Cannot write to `/storage/logs/custom.log` due to missing permissions.
- **Slow Database Queries**: Queries to `users` are slow, possibly due to missing indexes or server performance.

#### 2. Web Server Issues (`./chemin/bis/access.log`)
- **Missing Resources**: Requests for `/favicon.ico` fail due to missing file.
- **SSL Handshake Failure**: SSL connection issues, suggesting misconfiguration or invalid certificates.
- **Upstream Buffering**: Large file downloads are being buffered, may affect performance.

#### 3. System-Level Issues (System Check)
- **High Memory Usage**: Only 10.57% memory free, may cause slowdowns or failures under load.

#### 4. Connectivity Issues (Connectivity Check)
- **Missing HOST/PORT Environment Variables**: Application cannot determine where to connect for critical services (web, database, or cache).

### Step-by-Step Resolution

#### 1. Database Issues
- Ensure the `users` table exists in your database. If not, run migrations (e.g., `php artisan migrate` for Laravel) after confirming your database connection settings in `.env`.
- Check database connection credentials and ensure the database server is running and accessible.

#### 2. Application Code
- Review Blade templates (`post.blade.php`, `profile.blade.php`) for undefined/null variables. Ensure all expected data is passed from controllers.
- Implement null checks in templates, e.g., `{{ $post->title ?? 'No title' }}`.
- Verify `AdminController` exists and is correctly referenced in `routes/web.php`. Add missing `use` statement or create the controller if absent.
- Correct permissions on `/storage/logs/` so the web server user can write to `custom.log`.

#### 3. Web Server
- Add a `favicon.ico` file to `/usr/share/nginx/html/` or update HTML to prevent requests if not needed.
- Review SSL configuration and ensure certificates are valid and properly referenced in Nginx config.
- Check Nginx proxy buffering settings if large file downloads are common and adjust as needed.

#### 4. System Resources
- Close unused applications or upgrade server memory to reduce high memory usage.

#### 5. Environment Variables
- Set HOST and PORT variables in your `.env` file to allow correct network bindings and service communication.
