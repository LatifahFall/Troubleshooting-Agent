Diagnosis

### Issues Identified (from logs in ./chemin/bis/tetra.log, ./chemin/bis/laravel.log, ./chemin/bis/access.log, ./test/var/env/app.log, ./test/var/env/nginx_error.log):

**Application/Code Issues:**
- Missing database tables (`project.users`)
- Undefined variables in Blade templates
- Missing controllers (`AdminController`, `UserController`)
- Environment variable `APP_KEY` not set
- Permission errors writing to `storage/logs` and `storage/framework/cache`
- Class not found errors in routes and controllers
- Queue worker and Redis connection failures
- Mail configuration errors
- Session driver unavailable

**Web Server (Nginx) Issues:**
- Missing static files (favicon.ico, CSS)
- Connection refused/timeouts to upstream (backend not running or reachable)
- SSL handshake failures (certificate issues, no shared cipher)
- Large/broken HTTP headers, invalid chunked encoding, premature connection closing

**System/Environment Issues:**
- High memory usage (91%)
- Connectivity check fails due to missing HOST or PORT environment variables

---
### Resolution Steps

#### 1. Database & Laravel Setup
- Run migrations to create missing tables: `php artisan migrate`
- Ensure the database is running and accessible (check credentials in `.env`)

#### 2. Environment Variables
- Set the `APP_KEY` by running `php artisan key:generate` and verify all required variables are present in `.env`
- Define HOST and PORT variables as required for connectivity

#### 3. File & Directory Permissions
- Adjust permissions for `storage/logs` and `storage/framework/cache` so the webserver/application can write to them
- On Windows, ensure these directories are not read-only and the correct user has write access

#### 4. Code/Dependency Fixes
- Verify that all referenced controllers exist and are autoloaded
- Fix undefined variables in views and check existence of all used Blade variables
- Address missing static files (add favicon, CSS, etc.)

#### 5. Service Configuration
- Verify Redis and database services are running and reachable
- Fix mail configuration in `.env` for SMTP
- Ensure the session driver is correctly configured and its service is available

#### 6. Web Server & SSL
- Check Nginx configuration for proper upstream/backend settings
- Address SSL certificate issues (install valid certificates, configure ciphers)
- Tweak client_max_body_size, buffer and timeout settings if handling large requests

#### 7. System Resources
- Investigate causes of high memory usage and take action (restart unused processes, increase RAM if possible)

#### 8. Retest
- After applying the above, restart all services and retest app functionality
