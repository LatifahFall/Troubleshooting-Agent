Diagnosis

### Log Files Analyzed
- `chemin/bis/tetra.log`
- `chemin/bis/laravel.log`
- `chemin/bis/access.log`

### System and Connectivity Checks
- System: Windows 10, high memory usage (~91%), sufficient disk space
- Connectivity: FAILED due to missing HOST or PORT environment variables

---

### Diagnosis
#### 1. Database Table Missing
`tetra.log` shows: `SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'project.users' doesn't exist`. This means your Laravel application is trying to access a database table ('users') that does not exist. This is a critical issue for user authentication and related features.

#### 2. Undefined Variables and Missing Classes
- `laravel.log`: Undefined variable `$user` in `profile.blade.php`.
- `tetra.log`: Class `App\Http\Controllers\AdminController` not found. Likely a missing file or autoloading issue.

#### 3. File Permission Issues
- `tetra.log`: `file_put_contents(/storage/logs/custom.log): Failed to open stream: Permission denied`. The application cannot write to the log file, likely due to incorrect permissions.

#### 4. Web Server Errors
- `access.log`: Missing static file (`favicon.ico`), SSL handshake failure, and buffering of large upstream responses.

#### 5. Connectivity Misconfiguration
- Connectivity check: Missing HOST or PORT environment variables, which may affect database or web server startup.

#### 6. High System Memory Usage
- System check: 91% of RAM is used. This may cause further instability.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Database Migration**: Run `php artisan migrate` to create the missing 'users' table and other required tables.
2. **Blade and Controller Fixes**:
   - Ensure all variables used in Blade views (e.g., `$user` in `profile.blade.php`) are properly defined and passed.
   - Make sure `AdminController.php` exists in `app/Http/Controllers` and is properly referenced.
3. **File Permissions**:
   - Correct permissions for the `/storage/logs/` directory to allow the web server to write logs.
   - On Windows, ensure the user running the web server has write access.
4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Set the HOST and PORT in your environment (e.g., in `.env` for Laravel) so the web server and database can be reached.
5. **Web Server Issues**:
   - Add a `favicon.ico` to prevent 404s.
   - Investigate SSL configuration for handshake failures (check certificates, protocol versions).
   - For large file buffering, consider Nginx settings like `proxy_buffering` and resource limits.
6. **System Resources**:
   - Free up RAM by closing unnecessary applications or consider upgrading memory if possible.
