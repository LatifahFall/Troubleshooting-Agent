Diagnosis

### Summary
Based on the analysis of the following files:
- `chemin/bis/access.log`
- `chemin/bis/laravel.log`
- `chemin/bis/tetra.log`

And the results of the system and connectivity checks, here is a detailed diagnosis and step-by-step resolution plan.

### Diagnosis
**Nginx/Server Issues:**
- Missing favicon.ico file (not critical, but avoidable by adding the favicon).
- Warning about upstream response buffering (may indicate large file handling or slow backend response).
- Critical: SSL handshake failure, which can prevent secure connections.

**Laravel/Application Issues:**
- Undefined variable `$user` in a Blade view (`profile.blade.php`).
- Slow database queries detected.
- Critical: Database error ‚Äì `users` table is missing (`tetra.log`).
- Attempted access to null property `title` in `post.blade.php`.
- Missing `AdminController` class in route/web.php.
- File permission error writing to `/storage/logs/custom.log`.

**System Check:**
- High memory usage (88.7%).
- Ample disk space.

**Connectivity Check:**
- Critical: Missing HOST or PORT environment variables, blocking network connectivity.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Fix Environment Variables:**
   - Set the `HOST` and `PORT` variables in your `.env` file or environment (e.g., `HOST=127.0.0.1`, `PORT=8000`).
2. **Database/Migration:**
   - Run database migrations to create the missing `users` table:
     ```
     php artisan migrate
     ```
3. **Code Fixes:**
   - In `profile.blade.php`, ensure `$user` is defined and passed from the controller.
   - In `post.blade.php`, add a null check before accessing `$post->title`.
   - Create or import `AdminController` in `App\Http\Controllers` and make sure the `use` statement is present in your route/web.php.
4. **File Permissions:**
   - Ensure the `/storage/logs` directory is writable by the web server user.
5. **SSL/NGINX:**
   - Check SSL certificate configuration and renew or fix permissions if needed.
   - Add a favicon.ico to `/usr/share/nginx/html` to avoid 404 errors.
   - Monitor and optimize backend response time for large file requests.
6. **Performance:**
   - Restart unused applications to free up system memory.
   - Optimize database queries or add indexes as needed.

**System and Connectivity checks are NOT clear:** These must be resolved for the application to function correctly.
