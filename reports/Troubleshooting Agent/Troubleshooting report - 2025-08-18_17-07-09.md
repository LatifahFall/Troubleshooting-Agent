Diagnosis

### Summary of Findings

**Log files analyzed:**
- `chemin/bis/access.log` (Nginx errors)
- `chemin/bis/laravel.log` (Laravel application errors)
- `chemin/bis/tetra.log` (Laravel application errors)
- `test/var/env/app.log` (Laravel application errors)
- `test/var/env/nginx_error.log` (Nginx errors)

**System & Connectivity Results:**
- System: Windows 10, 22 CPUs, 15.37GB RAM (very high memory usage)
- Connectivity: Fails due to missing HOST or PORT environment variables

### Key Problems Identified

**1. Application Errors:**
- Missing or misconfigured environment variables (e.g., APP_KEY, HOST, PORT)
- Database connection refused (likely configuration or service issue, possibly related to missing HOST/PORT)
- Missing database tables (e.g., `users`)
- File and directory permission errors (cannot write to logs, cache, or storage)
- Missing controller classes or incorrect namespaces in routing
- Undefined variables in Blade templates
- SSL certificate and SMTP errors (unable to validate or connect)
- Redis connection failures
- Session driver misconfiguration

**2. Web Server (Nginx) Errors:**
- Connection refused and timeouts to upstream (application backend)
- SSL handshake failures and certificate issues
- Missing static files (e.g., CSS, favicon)
- Large or malformed headers from upstream

**3. System Resource Issue:**
- Extremely high RAM usage (>88%) could destabilize services

**4. Connectivity Misconfiguration:**
- Missing HOST and PORT environment variables prevent external connectivity

### Step-by-Step Resolution

#### 1. Environment Configuration
- Ensure the `.env` file (or equivalent) is complete and correct. Set all required variables:
    - `APP_KEY`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `MAIL_HOST`, `MAIL_PORT`, etc.
    - Specifically add/verify `HOST` and `PORT` variables for all relevant services.
- Restart the application after updating the `.env` file.

#### 2. Database Setup
- Check that the database service is running and accessible from the application.
- Run database migrations to create the necessary tables: `php artisan migrate`.
- Verify database credentials and network access (especially if the DB is remote).

#### 3. File Permissions
- Ensure the application has write permissions to `storage`, `logs`, and `cache` directories.
    - On Windows, right-click the folders, go to Security, and grant full control to the web server user.

#### 4. Codebase Issues
- Fix missing controller and class references. Check for typos and ensure all classes are imported correctly.
- Fix undefined variables in Blade templates (e.g., pass `$user` to view).

#### 5. SSL and SMTP
- Ensure valid SSL certificates are installed and trusted by the system.
- Update CA certificates as needed.
- Review mail configuration and test SMTP connectivity.

#### 6. Redis and Session
- Start the Redis server if not running.
- Verify Redis configuration in `.env` and Laravel config files.
- If Redis is not required, change session/cache driver to `file` in `.env`.

#### 7. Resource Management
- Investigate high memory usage. Restart unnecessary services or increase RAM if possible.
- Regularly monitor system resources.

#### 8. Nginx/Web Server
- Ensure the application backend is running and reachable by Nginx (`127.0.0.1:8000`).
- Check Nginx configuration for upstream, SSL, and static file paths.
- Place necessary static files (like favicon.ico, CSS) in the correct directories.

#### 9. Retry Connectivity Check
- Once HOST and PORT variables are set, rerun connectivity tests to confirm resolution.

**If you need step-by-step help with any specific section, let me know.**

**All diagnosis based on logs from:**
- `chemin/bis/access.log`
- `chemin/bis/laravel.log`
- `chemin/bis/tetra.log`
- `test/var/env/app.log`
- `test/var/env/nginx_error.log`

**System checks and connectivity status are also included in this analysis.**
