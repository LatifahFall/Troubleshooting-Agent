Diagnosis

### Issues Identified

#### From Log Files (all found in `./chemin/bis/`):
- **Database Error:** The `users` table does not exist, causing SQL errors (`tetra.log`, `laravel.log`).
- **Code/Template Errors:**
  - Attempt to read property `title` on null in `post.blade.php`.
  - Undefined variable `$user` in `profile.blade.php`.
  - `AdminController` class not found (likely missing file or use statement).
- **File Permission Error:** Permission denied writing to `/storage/logs/custom.log`.
- **Nginx/Server Issues:**
  - Missing `favicon.ico` (minor, but avoidable error).
  - Buffering large upstream responses (potential performance impact).
  - SSL handshake failures (critical for HTTPS).

#### System & Environment:
- **Memory Usage:** High RAM utilization (only ~13% free).
- **Connectivity:** Missing HOST or PORT environment variables, blocking proper network communication.

### Resolution Steps

1. **Database Fix:**
   - Ensure all required tables (e.g., `users`) exist. Run database migrations: `php artisan migrate` (for Laravel) or use your DB tool to create missing tables.

2. **Blade Template & Code Issues:**
   - Check `resources/views/post.blade.php` and ensure you always pass a valid `$post` object with a `title` property.
   - In `profile.blade.php`, make sure the `$user` variable is set and passed to the view.
   - Confirm that `AdminController.php` exists in `app/Http/Controllers/` and the correct namespace/use statement is present in `routes/web.php`.

3. **File Permissions:**
   - Adjust permissions so your web server can write to `/storage/logs/custom.log`: `chmod 664 /storage/logs/custom.log` and ensure the directory is writable by the web server user.

4. **Nginx/HTTPS Issues:**
   - Add a `favicon.ico` to `/usr/share/nginx/html/` to avoid 404s.
   - Investigate SSL certificate configuration for handshake errors; check your cert files and Nginx SSL block.
   - For large files, consider tuning Nginx buffering settings (`proxy_buffering`, `proxy_buffers`, etc.).

5. **System Resources:**
   - Monitor application memory usage. Consider upgrading RAM or optimizing your app if possible.

6. **Connectivity Variables:**
   - Define HOST and PORT in your `.env` file or deployment environment to restore network service. Example:
     ```
     HOST=127.0.0.1
     PORT=8000
     ```
