Diagnosis

### Summary of Issues

**Log files analyzed:**
- chemin/bis/access.log
- chemin/bis/laravel.log
- chemin/bis/tetra.log
- test/var/env/app.log
- test/var/env/nginx_error.log

**System check:** Windows 10, high memory usage (87.4%), sufficient disk space
**Connectivity check:** Missing HOST or PORT environment variables

### Main Problems Identified

1. **Missing or Incorrect Environment Variables**
   - Application is missing critical environment variables (e.g., APP_KEY, HOST, PORT). This prevents proper connectivity and service operation.
   - Resolution: Ensure all required environment variables are set in your .env file (especially database, mail, cache, session, APP_KEY, HOST, and PORT).

2. **Database Connection and Table Issues**
   - Logs show connection refused errors and missing tables (e.g., 'users').
   - Resolution: Verify your database is running and accessible. Check credentials and permissions. Run migrations to create missing tables.

3. **File & Directory Permissions**
   - Application cannot write to storage/logs and cache directories.
   - Resolution: Grant the web server and application user write permissions to these directories.

4. **Missing Classes/Controllers**
   - Errors indicate missing controller classes (UserController, AdminController).
   - Resolution: Ensure all source files are present and autoloaded. Run `composer dump-autoload` if using Composer.

5. **High Memory Usage**
   - System is low on available memory, which could cause timeouts and slow performance.
   - Resolution: Close unused applications/services, consider increasing server RAM, or optimize application memory usage.

6. **SSL and Web Server Errors**
   - Multiple SSL handshake failures, missing static files (favicon.ico, style.css), and large response header errors.
   - Resolution: Review SSL certificate configuration and ensure all required static files are present in the public directory. Check nginx/apache configuration for header limits.

7. **Redis, Mail, and Queue Failures**
   - Redis connection timeout, mail transport failure, and queue worker timeouts.
   - Resolution: Ensure Redis server is running and accessible, verify mail settings, and consider increasing queue worker timeout limits.

### Step-by-Step Resolution
1. Review and update your .env file for all required environment variables.
2. Start/restart your database, Redis, and mail services. Verify connectivity using correct host and port.
3. Run database migrations (e.g., `php artisan migrate`) to create missing tables.
4. Check and fix file permissions for storage, logs, and cache directories.
5. Ensure all controllers and classes exist and are properly loaded.
6. Address SSL certificate issues and ensure static files exist in your public directory.
7. Monitor system memory and optimize or upgrade resources as needed.
8. After changes, restart web server and application services.

### System and Connectivity Checks
- **System check:** High memory usage identified. No disk issues.
- **Connectivity check:** Fails due to missing HOST or PORT environment variables. This must be fixed for proper operation.
