## Rapport de l'agent

## Diagnosis

• Log files analyzed: chemin/bis/access.log, chemin/bis/laravel.log, chemin/bis/tetra.log

### Findings

• Nginx/Web server issues:Missing `favicon.ico` file (access.log)
• Critical SSL handshake failure (access.log)
• Large file requests are being buffered (access.log)

Application (Laravel) issues:

• Undefined variable `$user` in `profile.blade.php` (laravel.log)
• Slow database queries (laravel.log)
• Missing database table `users` (tetra.log)
• Attempt to access property `title` on null in `post.blade.php` (tetra.log)
• Class `AdminController` not found (tetra.log)
• File write permission error for `custom.log` (tetra.log)

System: OS and disk are healthy, but RAM usage is high (86% used).Connectivity:Critical: Missing HOST or PORT environment variables. This will prevent connections to essential services (e.g., database).

### Step-by-Step Resolution

1. Fix environment variables:Edit your `.env` file and ensure all required variables (such as `HOST`, `PORT`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`) are set correctly for your environment.
2. Database:Run database migrations to create missing tables: `php artisan migrate` (or the equivalent for your stack).
3. Verify the database connection settings in `.env`.
4. Code & Template Fixes:In `profile.blade.php`: Ensure `$user` is always defined when rendering the view.
5. In `post.blade.php`: Add null checks before accessing `title`.
6. Add or fix `AdminController` class and ensure proper `use` statements.
7. Permissions:Ensure the application has write permission to the `/storage/logs` directory.
8. Nginx/Web server:Add a `favicon.ico` to `/usr/share/nginx/html` or update the web server configuration to avoid this error.
9. Check SSL certificate configuration to resolve handshake errors.
10. Performance: High RAM usage may affect performance; consider closing other applications or upgrading RAM if persistent.

All system and disk checks are clear except for high memory usage. Connectivity check is NOT CLEAR due to missing environment variables.
