## Diagnosis

Based on the analysis of the following log files from `chemin/bis/`:
- `tetra.log`
- `laravel.log`
- `access.log`

And the results of system and connectivity checks, several issues have been identified:

### Laravel/Application Issues
1. **Database Table Missing:**
   - `tetra.log` shows: `Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'project.users' doesn't exist`. This indicates your database is missing the required `users` table.
2. **Undefined Variables and Missing Classes:**
   - Errors such as `Undefined variable $user` in Blade templates and `Class 'AdminController' not found` point to code quality/control issues.
3. **File Permission Problem:**
   - The app cannot write to `/storage/logs/custom.log` due to permission denial.

### Laravel Performance Warnings
- `laravel.log` reports slow queries, likely due to database or system load issues.

### Nginx/Web Server Issues
- `access.log` shows:
  - Missing static files (favicon.ico)
  - Large file buffering issues
  - Critical SSL handshake failure (possible misconfiguration)

### System and Connectivity
- **Memory Usage:** High RAM usage (86% used, only 2GB free)
- **Connectivity Check:** Fails due to missing HOST/PORT environment variables, likely preventing database or webserver connections.

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Database Setup
- Ensure your database is running and accessible.
- Create the missing `users` table (or run all migrations):
  ```
  php artisan migrate
  ```
- Confirm your `.env` file has correct DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD values.

### 2. Environment Variables
- Add required HOST and PORT values to `.env` as needed (for app and database connectivity).
- Restart your web server/application after updating `.env`.

### 3. File Permissions
- Ensure the `/storage` directory and its subdirectories are writable by the web server user.
  - On Linux, for example:
    ```
    chmod -R 775 storage
    chown -R www-data:www-data storage
    ```
  - On Windows, right-click the folder > Properties > Security, and ensure write permissions for the appropriate user.

### 4. Code Quality
- Check that all controllers and variables used in views exist and are imported/defined correctly.
- Fix undefined variables in Blade templates.

### 5. Nginx/Web Server
- Add a `favicon.ico` to your public directory to prevent 404s.
- Review SSL certificate configuration for handshake errors.
- If buffering large responses, tune Nginx proxy settings (e.g., `proxy_buffering`, `proxy_buffers`).

### 6. System Resources
- Consider closing unused applications or increasing system RAM if possible.

---

**Summary:**
- Fix missing database table and environment variables first.
- Address file permissions and code errors.
- Tackle web server config and SSL issues.
