(See tetra.log)\n2. **View & Code Errors:** There are undefined variables in Blade view templates and attempts to access properties on null objects. (See laravel.log and tetra.log)\n3. **Class Not Found:** The AdminController class is missing or not properly imported. (See tetra.log)\n4. **File Permissions:** The app cannot write to '/storage/logs/custom.log' due to permissions. (See tetra.log)\n5. **Web Server Issues:**\n   - Missing favicon.ico file.\n   - Buffering large HTTP responses.\n   - SSL handshake failure, possibly due to certificate/config issues. (See access.log)\n6. **System:** System check is mostly clear, though memory usage is high (88%).\n7. **Connectivity:** The HOST or PORT environment variables are missing, which breaks network connectivity for the application or web server.\n\n**Resolution Steps:**\n1. **Database:**\n   - Create the missing 'users' table or restore it from a backup as required by your application schema.\n2. **Blade View Fixes:**\n   - Ensure all variables passed to views are defined and not null.\n   - Add null checks before accessing properties such as 'title'.\n3. **Class Resolution:**\n   - Verify 'AdminController' exists in 'App\\Http\\Controllers'.\n   - Ensure it is properly imported/used in 'routes/web.php'.\n4. **File Permissions:**\n   - Grant write permissions to the '/storage/logs/' directory for the user running the application.\n5. **Web Server:**\n   - Add a favicon.ico or update the config to suppress 404 errors for it.\n   - Review and optimize handling of large files in Nginx.\n   - Fix SSL certificate settings and ensure certificates are valid and properly configured.\n6. **System Resources:**\n   - Investigate memory usage; consider optimizing code or increasing available RAM if performance issues arise.\n7. **Connectivity:**\n   - Set the required HOST and PORT environment variables in your .env file or system configuration to enable network connectivity for the application.\n\nIf you need step-by-step guidance on any of these points, please specify which problem you'd like to resolve first."
