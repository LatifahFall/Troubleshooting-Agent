Diagnosis

### Log Files Reviewed
- `chemin/bis/laravel.log`
- `chemin/bis/tetra.log`
- `chemin/bis/access.log`

### System and Connectivity
- **System Check:** System is running Windows 10, but memory usage is very high (89%).
- **Connectivity Check:** Failed due to missing HOST or PORT environment variables.

### Key Issues Found
1. **Application Errors (Laravel):**
   - Undefined variable `$user` in `profile.blade.php` (line 22)
   - Attempt to read property on null in `post.blade.php`
   - 'AdminController' class not found
   - Database error: Missing `users` table (`project.users`)
   - File permission error writing to `/storage/logs/custom.log`
2. **Nginx/HTTP Errors:**
   - Missing static file: `favicon.ico`
   - Large file downloads buffering to disk (potential performance issue)
   - SSL handshake failure (TLS/SSL configuration issue)
3. **System Resources:**
   - Very high memory usage (only 1.7 GB available)
4. **Configuration:**
   - Missing HOST or PORT environment variables, preventing proper connectivity.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Fix Application Errors:**
   - Define the `$user` variable or properly pass it to `profile.blade.php`.
   - Ensure object variables are properly initialized before accessing their properties.
   - Check that `AdminController` exists and is properly referenced (including any necessary `use` statements).
   - Run database migrations to create the missing `users` table (e.g., `php artisan migrate`).
   - Fix permissions on `/storage/logs/` so the application can write logs.
2. **Resolve Nginx/HTTP Issues:**
   - Add a `favicon.ico` to the web root or update references to prevent 404s.
   - Optimize large file handling settings in nginx and PHP to reduce buffering.
   - Review and fix SSL/TLS configuration for proper certificate and protocol support.
3. **System Resource Management:**
   - Investigate running processes and free up memory where possible.
   - Consider upgrading RAM or moving services to a host with more available memory if usage remains high.
4. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Set the required HOST and PORT environment variables in your `.env` file.
   - Restart relevant services after updating the configuration.
