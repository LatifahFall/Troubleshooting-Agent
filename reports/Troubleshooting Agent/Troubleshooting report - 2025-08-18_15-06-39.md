### Summary of Issues

#### Application Errors (from logs in './chemin/bis/' and './test/var/env/')
- **Undefined variable $user** in profile.blade.php
- **Base table or view not found: 'users'** (database schema is incomplete or migrations not run)
- **Missing controller classes** (e.g., AdminController, UserController)
- **Permission denied** when writing to log, cache, or storage directories
- **Missing environment variables** (e.g., APP_KEY, HOST, PORT)
- **Database/Redis/SMTP connection failures** (likely due to configuration or service issues)
- **SSL certificate validation errors**
- **Queue worker timeouts**

#### Nginx/Web Server Errors (from './chemin/bis/access.log' and './test/var/env/nginx_error.log')
- **Missing assets** (favicon.ico, style.css)
- **Upstream connection failures, timeouts, and reset errors**
- **SSL handshake failures**
- **Header too big/invalid HTTP header/invalid chunked encoding**

#### System Environment
- **Critically low available RAM** (only 0.91GB free, 94% RAM usage)
- **Network connectivity check failed** due to missing HOST/PORT environment variables

### Step-by-Step Resolution

#### 1. Fix Environment Variables
- Set all required environment variables in your .env file:
  - Database: DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD
  - Redis: REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT
  - Mail: MAIL_HOST, MAIL_PORT, MAIL_USERNAME, MAIL_PASSWORD
  - Application: APP_KEY (generate via `php artisan key:generate` if missing)
  - Any additional HOST/PORT variables needed by your stack

#### 2. Address File/Directory Permissions
- Ensure the `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/` directories are writable by the web server user.

#### 3. Database Setup
- Run database migrations with `php artisan migrate` to create missing tables (such as 'users').
- Ensure the database server is running and accessible at the configured host/port.

#### 4. Install Missing Classes
- Ensure all required controllers (e.g., AdminController, UserController) exist and are properly included (with correct namespace and use statements).

#### 5. Fix Code Issues
- Resolve undefined variables in Blade templates (e.g., pass $user to profile.blade.php).
- Add checks for null values before accessing properties (e.g., in post.blade.php).

#### 6. Address SSL and Mail Issues
- Install valid SSL certificates and configure Nginx accordingly.
- For SSL errors in PHP (Guzzle), ensure the CA certificates are updated on the system.
- Verify SMTP credentials and port; ensure outgoing connections are allowed.

#### 7. Improve System Resources
- Free up RAM or increase available memory on the server. Consider restarting unnecessary processes or resizing the server.

#### 8. Asset Management
- Add missing assets (favicon.ico, style.css) to the public directory to avoid 404s.

#### 9. Nginx/Proxy Tuning
- Increase buffer and header size limits if you are serving large files or responses.
- Review upstream timeouts and adjust as needed.

#### 10. Check Network Connectivity
- Ensure HOST and PORT environment variables are set for all services.
- Verify external service endpoints are reachable from your server.
