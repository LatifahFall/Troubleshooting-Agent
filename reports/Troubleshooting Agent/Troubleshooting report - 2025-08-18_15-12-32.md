Diagnosis

Based on the logs from 'chemin/bis/tetra.log', 'chemin/bis/laravel.log', and 'chemin/bis/access.log', as well as system and connectivity checks, the following issues have been identified:

1. Database table 'users' is missing, causing SQL errors.
2. Undefined variables and missing classes in Blade views and controllers.
3. File permission errors for log writing.
4. Nginx errors with missing files and SSL handshake failures.
5. System memory usage is above 90%, which can degrade performance.
6. Critical: HOST or PORT environment variables are missing, preventing connectivity to required external services (database, Redis, etc).

Resolution Steps

1. Review and update your `.env` file to include all required environment variables, especially HOST and PORT settings for services such as the database and Redis.
2. Run `php artisan migrate` to create any missing database tables (e.g., 'users').
3. Fix file and directory permissions for 'storage/' and related log directories to ensure the application can write logs.
4. Address undefined variables and missing classes in your codebase (Blade views and controllers).
5. For nginx issues, ensure all required static files exist and your SSL configuration is correct.
6. Consider closing unused applications or adding system RAM to improve memory availability.

If you need step-by-step help with any specific item above, please specify which issue you'd like to resolve first.

Log files consulted: 'chemin/bis/tetra.log', 'chemin/bis/laravel.log', 'chemin/bis/access.log'.
System and connectivity checks confirm high memory usage and missing environment variables.
